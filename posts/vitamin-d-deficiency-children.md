As a hormone, vitamin D accomplishes many things in the body. It was first discovered as a substance that can prevent and treat rickets and controls the level of calcium and phosphate ions in the blood and the absorption of calcium and magnesium in the intestines.

When you are outdoors, it is important to protect your skin to avoid skin cancer and skin damage from too much sun exposure.

- **Food Sources**

Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Foods that contain the most vitamin D are fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, liver, eggs, and fish oil. 

**Fortified vitamin D products** such as milk, yogurt, infant formula, juices, cereals, and other foods. According to FSSAI (Fortification of Foods) Regulations 2018, adding vitamin D to food is called "strengthening." This is useful, but maybe not enough.

- **Supplement**

To get enough vitamin D, children usually need to take a multivitamin containing vitamin D or a vitamin D supplement. Vitamin D is sometimes referred to as vitamin D3. Vitamin D supplements such as vitamin D capsules, chewing gum, gum, liquids, without a prescription.

**Children at risk** 

- Children with dark skin tone (melanin) act as a natural sunscreen and increase the time they spend in the sun to naturally produce vitamin D.
- Children whose skin is rarely exposed to the sun, eg. those who stay indoors or wear clothes to coveralls.
- premature baby
