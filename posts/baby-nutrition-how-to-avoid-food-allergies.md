**Baby Nutrition – How to Avoid Food Allergies**

<!-- ![](/images/posts/img2.png) -->


**Did you know nearly 5% of children under the age of five have food allergies?**

No one understands why, but food allergies in children are becoming increasingly common.

Beginning solid foods for your baby is an exciting time for parents. However, this brings up a lot of questions and concerns, especially when it comes to food allergies.

New research indicates that eating many foods together is safe and may help the immune system to have a lower risk of developing food allergies, but more research is needed. Talk to your doctor about what is best for your baby.

**What foods are most likely to trigger allergies in babies? How do you avoid them?**

Let's learn some important facts about babies' foods that are most likely to trigger allergies in babies.

**What is Food Allergy?**

A food allergy occurs when the body reacts to a protein in food that it mistakenly believes is harmful. Whether or not a baby will develop a food allergy is specified in part by genes, but other dietary and lifestyle factors can also play a role.

**Gradually begin to identify food allergies in child**

The most important thing is to slowly introduce the baby to new foods that are food allergies. Otherwise, parents may have a hard time associating the allergy with certain new foods. 

For example, if you give your baby three new foods in one day and he has an allergic reaction, you won't know which food provoked him.

Some important facts-

- The type of food or the order in which food is introduced doesn't really matter as long as the food you offer is healthy and balanced for the baby. 
- Every time you offer a new dish, you should wait three to five days before adding a new dish to the menu. 
- Don't skip other foods your baby eats during this time; they already know they are safe because the child has not had any food reactions so far. Just don't add anything new.
- With any new food, you should monitor for allergic reactions.
- There is no evidence that waiting for a baby to grow prevents food allergies. 
- If you think your baby is having an allergic reaction to a food, such as diarrhea, rash, or vomiting, talk to your pediatrician about the best diet.

**Top 8 allergies and babies**

There are more than 160 food allergies and the following eight foods or food groups are known to be less likely to cause problems with allergic reactions, perhaps up to 90% of the time. 

Food allergies are caused by the following eight foods are

1. Cow’s Milk
1. Wheat
1. Soy 
1. Eggs
1. Peanuts
1. Nuts (such as Almonds (badam), hazelnuts (pahadi badaam), walnuts (akhrot), pistachios (pista), cashews (kaju))
1. Fish (such as like tuna (chura), salmon (raawas), and cod (gaabro))
1. Shellfish (such as lobster, shrimp, prawn and crab)

Eggs, milk, and peanuts are the most common causes of food allergies in children, including wheat, soy, and tree nuts. 

Peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish usually cause the most severe reactions. 

Although most children outgrow their allergies, allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish can last a lifetime.

**What are the symptoms of a food allergy?**

Allergy symptoms can appear within minutes to an hour after consuming allergens foods. Symptoms can be different for each child depending on food allergy and their level (low, mild, or high). Some Symptoms are

- Vomiting
- blocked nose, sneezing, watery eyes
- Diarrhea
- Cramps
- Face, tongue, or lip swelling
- Eczema
- Breathing problem
- Loss of consciousness
- Coughing or wheezing
- Hyperventilating
- Low blood pressure

**Symptoms of a severe food allergy: when to see a doctor**

Severe allergic reactions can be incurable or fatal very fast. 

If your baby is having an issue of trouble breathing or wheezing, swell on their face or lips, or develops severe vomiting or diarrhea after eating, immediately take your child to your pediatrician as soon as possible.

**What if my child's food allergies don't appear immediately?**

Delayed allergic reactions are more challenging to spot but are more common. Your child's body will take longer to respond because different parts of their immune system are affected. These allergies are called late-onset allergies or allergies that are not IgE-mediated.

Signs and symptoms to observe are

- Reflux
- Stomach discomfort, Diarrhea and Constipation
- Mucus or blood in your child's stool
- Moderate to severe eczema, which is common in infants with milk allergies

However, all of these symptoms usually appear in early childhood. Allergies are only one possible justification.

**Management of light food allergies in infants**

If you notice mild symptoms, such as hives or a rash, consult with your pediatrician for further evaluation. 

**How is food allergies diagnosed in children?**

Your child doctor may refer you to an allergist (allergy sufferer) who will ask additional questions and perform a physical exam. Allergies may require diagnostic tests such as:

- **Skin test -** This test involves applying a liquid extract of a food allergen to your child's arm or back, pricking the skin, and waiting to observe if a red bump forms within 15 minutes. A positive test for food only indicates that your child may be sensitive to that food.
- **Blood tests -** to check the blood for IgE antibodies to certain foods

**Relationship between family food and allergies**

If you have a family history of food allergies, your baby is also at a higher risk of developing allergies, although this is uncertain. If you have allergies, the chances are 50-50 and they have them.

It is best to introduce the 8 allergens one at a time, one to two weeks apart, over a period of time so you can see if an allergy develops.

**Protect your baby from food allergies: effortless to perform**

WHO and the Ministry of Health recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months. At six months of age, you introduce solids into your baby's diet and you can talk to your baby's doctor about weaning him.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that potential allergens be introduced to your baby sooner rather than later. In this way, it can help prevent the development of an allergy to the food.

Breastfeeding your baby for 4-6 months is the best way to prevent milk allergies. Remember that breast milk or formula is more nutritious. If you start using whole milk, you should do so under the supervision of a doctor. 

The AAP recommends that infants at high risk of allergies should be introduced to peanuts between 4 and 6 months. 

Babies most at risk of developing a peanut allergy are those with eczema an egg allergy, or both. 

It was initially believed that introducing babies to food when they were older could make any reaction more controllable.

**Key facts to remember**

- According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, most foods are not needed to trigger a severe reaction in people with severe allergies. In fact, only 1/44,000 of a nut can cause an allergic reaction in a highly allergic person.
- Symptoms of a food allergy can imitate other issues or diseases. Always consult your pediatrician for a diagnosis.
- Keep in mind that just because your baby's initial allergic reaction to a new food may be mild, it could get worse after exposure. 
- Some allergies go away with time. Allergies to eggs and milk often go away as children grow up, but allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish usually continue.
