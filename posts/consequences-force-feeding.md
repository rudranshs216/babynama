**Why do parents usually force-feed their children?**

Force-feeding on a child to eat is usually done with the best of intentions, but it can have unintended outcomes.

Parents constantly worry when their child eats very little, or does not eat healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables, or proper and well-balanced meals, or refuses to eat at all. For some, this concern can be significant, especially if the child is not gaining or losing weight well. For others, uneaten food can be a source of frustration. 

As a Parent, they force their child to eat just to make sure the child gets a balanced diet for proper growth and won't suffer any kind of deficiency disease.

Parents often find that they use force, pressure, or intimidation to try to get their child to finish their meals. This can take many shapes such as

- **Pressure** - "I want you to eat all your veggie"
- **Warning** - "Just eat that little piece in there"
- **Emotional Blackmail** - "A good girl will eat her dinner after mom has worked hard to cook it"
- **Using Rules** - "Eat two chapatis because you are big now"
- **Bribes** - "If you eat everything on your plate you can leave the table and play"
- **Punishment** - "You can't watch TV if you haven't finished your food"
- **Forced feeding** – “physically putting food into the child's mouth and forcing him to swallow”

Here are some reasons why parents force-feed their children

- **Introducing new foods**

Parents often force their children to eat when they are introduced to a new fruit, vegetable, or food while thinking is supported by the idea that children must be fed constantly in order for them to get a taste and essential nutrition.

- **Worried that the child is not eating enough**

Young children eat less, but frequently. Parents believe that their child may not be consuming or receiving sufficient nutrition from small meals to make a living and healthy.

- **Lack of understanding of children's needs**

As parents, we believe that we are more aware of our child's needs, and the same goes for food. Therefore, when a child refuses to eat, parents often tend to force the meal, thinking that the child does not understand the demands of his body.

- **To complete what is presented on the plate**

Most of us have the idea that once it's on the plate, it ends up in our stomachs. However, this is not the case with children as they will only eat as much as their stomachs allow.

- **When introducing solid foods**

This is a very common feeding mistake that parents provoke when they preferably start feeding their babies. The goal is not to force the baby to eat the food he doesn't like but to let the baby develop a taste and then let him choose what he likes to eat.

- **Spoon feeds to older children**

Many parents happily feed their children even when they are old enough to support themselves because they believe that they may not be able to help themselves. This leads to overeating.
