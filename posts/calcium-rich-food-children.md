Your child's body needs calcium to build and maintain strong bones and teeth.

The amount of calcium absorbed into our bones depends on the amount of calcium we consume and how much vitamin D we get. 

**Vitamin D** is essential for calcium absorption and is primarily obtained from sunlight and can also be found in small amounts in foods such as fish and egg yolks. Many foods are already fortified with vitamin D, for example, margarine, muesli, milk and yogurt, and juices.

Our bones are represented as "calcium banks". If calcium is not stored, it is taken from the bones for use in other parts of the body. If this continues, over time the bones can become weak and brittle, which can lead to osteoporosis (in adulthood).

The risks of intaking too little calcium or not getting enough calcium mean calcium deficiency. **Calcium deficiency can cause health problems** related to weak bones, poor growth, and soft bones that lead to rickets in children resulting in not reaching their full potential grown-up height.




**Recommended Intake of Calcium**

The RDA of calcium for various age groups of children are-

- Infant (0-12 months)  - 500 mg/d
- Child (1-8 years)      - 600 mg/d
- Child ( ≥9 years)      -  800 mg/d
