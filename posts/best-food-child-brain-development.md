**Best Boosting Food for child's brain development**


BRAIN is a very important organ that controls every process to regulate our body.

Did you know that your brain is only about 3% of your body weight but uses up to 17% of your energy? 

**Did you know that the brain is referred to as a very hungry organ?**

**Do you want your child to have adequate brain function?** 

**Do you know most of the development of the child brain occurs in 5 years?**

Diet plays a very important role in brain development. 

Then pay close attention to their diet because some "brain foods" can help boost a child's brain growth as well as improve brain function, memory and focus. Also, feeding the body unhealthy food leads to the brain suffering.

So let’s learn more about what the child's brain needs!

This articles contains-

What are the most important nutrients for brain development ??

What are brain boosting healthy foods for children??

What about Supplements for my Child’s Brain Health?

What are the other priorities of Increase Brain Power?



**Most Important Nutrients for brain development**

All nutrients are essential for adequate brain function but some particular essential nutrients are needed to support brain function. These nutrients are-

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids -** to improve intellectual performance like thought processing, memorization, and learning. It also helps to reduce & prevent symptoms of ADHD, Alzheimer's, and dementia.
- **B Vitamins -** to improve mood and mental performance. It also helps to reduce anxiety, depression, migraines, PMS symptoms, and the risk of heart disease. 
- **Vitamin K -** to boost cognitive function and brainpower 
- **Vitamin E -** to prevent or slow cognitive decline and improve memory as the brain ages
- **Lycopene -** to protect against dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease
- **Zinc -** to improve memory and thinking ability
- **Choline -** to produce acetylcholine (an important neurotransmitter) which is essential for brains and nervous systems functions such as memory, muscle control, and mood. 
- **Iodine -** to produce thyroid hormones, which play a vital role in brain development

**Brain-Boosting Healthy Foods for Child**

- **Green leafy vegetables** such as **spinach**, **kale**, and **lettuce** are composed of brain-protecting compounds like folate, vitamins E & K1, flavonoids, and carotenoids for better cognitive scores in children.
- **Eggs** are loaded with nutrients such as choline, vitamin B12, protein, and selenium that help to stimulate brain development and cognitive function.
- **Oranges** and **orange juice** are good sources of flavonoids like hesperidin and narirutin for increased nerve activity and blood flow to the brain to promote cognitive function.
- **Yogurt** is a child's favorite unsweetened drink which is an ideal source to support their brain health. It is a good source of iodine, protein, zinc, vitamin B12, and selenium.
- **Fish** and **fish oil** are excellent sources of omega-3 fats, iodine, and zinc.
- **Whole grains** such as **cereals**, **oatmeal**, **quinoa**, and **barley** provide glucose, an energy source the brain needs and also a good source of B vitamins and fiber.** 
- **Milk** is a good source of protein, B-vitamins, vitamin D that help a child's neuromuscular system and the overall life cycle of human cells.
- **Apples** can help produce a chemical called acetylcholine, which helps carry messages between nerves in the brain. The presence of antioxidants in it helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals to the brain.
- **Berries** such as **strawberry**, **blueberry**, and **blackberry** are loaded with plentiful plant compounds called anthocyanins that help brain health such as increasing blood flow to the brain, providing anti-inflammatory effects, and boosting the production of new nerve cells and the expression of certain proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF which is concerned in learning and memory).
- **Beans** are a source of protein, complex carbs, fiber, vitamins, and minerals which keep a child's energy and thinking level at peak in the afternoon if they relish them with lunch.
- **Nuts** such as **walnuts** and **cashews** are a good source of omega3 fats, copper, magnesium, and amino acids. Almonds are a plentiful source of fiber, plant-based protein, and other nutrients like monounsaturated fats, vitamins, and minerals.
- **Turmeric** contains curcumin which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that help to improve children’s brainpower. It also prevents the growth of beta-amyloid plaque in the brain.
- **Colorful Veggies -** **Tomatoes** (contain lycopene), **sweet potatoes** (contain a collection of nutrients), **pumpkin** (good source of magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron), **carrots**, **spinach**, and **other vegetables** are rich in various nutrients and deep in color.  Deep-colored fruits & vegetables contribute to a healthy and strong brain as they are rich in antioxidants.

**What about Supplements for my Child’s Brain Health?**

Concentrate on food first to maintain optimal nutrition and develop your child's brain. However, there are some nutritional supplements for a child's brain. These are 

- **Phosphatidylserine** - important for nourishing nerve cell function and myelin (an insulating and protective coating around nerve fibers) formation.
- **Omega 3** - If your child doesn't like seafood or doesn't eat (vegetarian), then omega-3 supplements are a great way. Omega-3 is required to be intake more than once a week. 
- **Lutein** - carotenoid-derivatives essential for healthy brain and eye development.
- **Green veggie** - Is your  baby picky about vegetables? Adding a good quality green supplement can be a great solution for a developing palate. 
- **Magnesium** - Anything that is anxious, nervous, or uneasy is the work of magnesium. Because the soil content is less than a third of its original value, many adults and children do not consume enough magnesium.






**Other Prioritize of Increase Brain Power**

Despite the brain being affected after intake of proper food or nutrition, there may be some behaviors that you should prioritize in your child to prompt healthy brain growth and development. These are

- Getting enough sleep 
- Develop or stick to a convenient bedtime routine
- Stay Hydrated (a child's brain is made up of 75% water)
- Eating a High-Protein Breakfast

**Conclusion**

The early years of a child's life are very important in terms of health and further development. One of the main reasons for this is how fast the brain grows, beginning before birth and into early childhood. Despite the brain continuing to develop and transform during adolescence especially, in the prefrontal cortex (an area of the brain which is known as the "personality center''), the first 8 years can provide a foundation for future learning, health, and success in life. 

Accordingly, a healthy diet and the right nutrients are essential for brain function to function properly.
