<!-- ![](/images/posts/Aspose.Words.3a2727c6-1b48-4ba4-a2cc-06f9596f5fab.001.png) -->

**Did you know Vitamin C has long been praised for its potential health benefits in fighting the common cold?**

**Did you know that vitamin C is very important for your child's health and development?**

Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient, which means that anything that is not used by the body daily will be excreted. Therefore, vitamin C cannot be stored in the body and must be increased intake regularly. 

Fortunately, vitamin C is found in many foods, especially brightly colored fruits, and vegetables. You can help your child meet their daily vitamin C needs by encouraging foods.

Let's learn in detail why vitamin C is so important.

**What is Vitamin C?**

Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin for your child's health to prevent vitamin C deficiency such as delayed tissue development, scurvy, respiratory problems, and skin diseases. 

Since vitamin C cannot be produced in the body itself, the only option is to include vitamin C-rich food sources in your child's diet.

**RDA of Vitamin C for your Child**

According to ICMR, recommended daily allowance (RDI) of vitamin C for children is 

- **Lactating women (0-12 months)** – 80 mg/day
- **Infant (0-12 months) -** 25 mg/day
- **Child (1-17 years)     -** 40 mg/day

An adequate supply of vitamin C plays several important optimal health roles across the life cycle in the child's health. The benefits of vitamin C are

- **Booster for Immunity System** 

Vitamin C is required for the normal immune function to maintain the immune response and may play a role in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. If vitamin C is taken regularly, it can shorten the duration and severity of colds and help relieve cold symptoms.

- **Increase Iron absorption**

Vitamin C increases the absorption of iron from food. This is very useful for children because their rapid growth requires high iron.

- **Support Antioxidant Effects**

Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, even helps to regenerate the antioxidant vitamin E, and helps protect cells from free radical damage in the body. Free radicals are compounds formed by normal processes in the body and exposure to potentially harmful substances such as cigarette smoke, UV radiation, and air pollution. 

- **Support Collagen and Wound Healing**

The body needs vitamin C to create and strengthen collagen in bones, cartilage, muscles, and blood vessels. Vitamin C also helps heal minor wounds and keep your child's teeth and gums healthy.

Some vitamin C-rich foods to incorporate into your children's diet plan are

- **Citrus fruits** such as **lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruit** contain up to 70 mg of vitamin C. Oranges and limes can be plugged into a delicious refresh beverage that will appeal to your child's taste buds.

- **Amla** is a very concentrated supply of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Chewing one piece of amla or 1 teaspoon amla juice a day is enough for your kids to increase vitamin C levels and boost immune system protective properties.
- **Strawberries** are rich in vitamin C fruit. They are also rich in fiber and antioxidants. Mix strawberries with flavored yogurt or blend it into a smoothie or custard to make a delicious snack for your child.
- **Black currant** is a desirable deep purple color popular vitamin C-rich fruit among children of all ages which is also rich in potassium, phytochemicals, iron, and vitamin B5. Sprinkled blackcurrants on muesli and cornflakes can be good for breakfast to give your child the vitamin C they need.
- Rich red **tomatoes** are a good source of vitamin C. Tomatoes in salads or trimmed in veggies are good to add every day to a child's diet.
- **Kiwi** is a good source of vitamin C that helps keep the skin healthy. It also provides vitamin E (tocopherol).
- **Broccoli** is one such vegetable that can never fool you with its incredible nutritional benefits. While broccoli isn't good for kids, you can try mixing it into sandwiches or hiding it in fried rice. Broccoli is also a great source of detoxifying enzymes that can defend against harmful free radicals from the body.
- Many **herbs** such as **parsley, cilantro, basil, onion, and thyme** are quite rich in vitamin C and you can add them to your cooking to increase the amount of vitamin C in your child’s diet.

**Symptoms of Vitamin C Deficiency in Kids**

**How to discover if my child is deficient in vitamin C or not?**

Vitamin C deficiency is very rare in children unless they have severe intestinal malabsorption or poor eating habits of avoiding vitamin C sources.

The main disease caused by vitamin C deficiency is scurvy, which is very rare. 

Children with scurvy may have small brown spots on the skin, rough skin, thickening of the gums, and bleeding from the mucous membranes. They may also have symptoms of weakness or discomfort, emotional changes, poor wound healing, bone pain, end-stage jaundice, nerve damage, and seizures.

**Can vitamin C deficiency be prevented in children?**

Vitamin C deficiency can be prevented by eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. 

For example, one orange per day provides enough vitamins C.

**Too Much intake of Vitamin C Supplements**

Most babies should not need to intake vitamin C supplements.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), infant formula, breast milk, and food should be the only sources of vitamin C your baby needs to consume.

Vitamin C supplementation is not necessary for most healthy infants and can even increase the risk of developing symptoms associated with vitamin C poisoning.

Possible side effects associated with excess vitamin C intake are kidney stones, nausea, and diarrhea.

If taking supplements is supposedly necessary, the dosage should be determined by your baby's doctor or if you suspect your baby is not getting enough vitamin C, you may need to take a supplement. Because a severe deficiency of vitamin C is a major cause of the serious condition known as scurvy.

**Conclusion**

The content of vitamin C in food can be reduced during storage and long cooking because it is easily damaged by heat. Therefore, you should encourage the child to consume raw fruits and vegetables or steamed vegetables whenever possible. Don't worry if your child is getting more than they need, as excess vitamin C that is not being used by the body will be expelled. A child who doesn't eat a lot of fruit or vegetables may need a vitamin C supplement to increase their daily intake.

Be sure to consult a pediatrician before adding any supplements to your baby's diet to choose the safest and most right dose.
