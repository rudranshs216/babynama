**Food Pyramid for Children - Guess the Main Components**

<!-- ![](/images/posts/Aspose.Words.fa547301-c2b5-4321-acdc-5c874d59a531.001.png) -->

It's never too early to start paying attention to what your child is eating. Ensuring that their daily diet is mixed, nutritious, and less-sweet and low-salty foods is not only good for their health but also helps set the stage for a positive relationship between your child and the food they are putting into their body.

“Normal is boring” is great for eating. Children desire variety and see every day dishes boring. As your child grows older, you tend to worry about their eating habits and think more often about whether they are getting enough food, eating on time, and whether or not they are nutritious. So let's take a look at nutritious baby food with the help of food pyramid.

**What is a Food Pyramid?**

The food pyramid is used to help to understand a balanced diet.  Usually, children need a healthy and balanced diet to complete their growth and a balanced diet comprises a proportionate portion of foods that belong to specific but basic food groups, such as vegetables, whole grains, and so on. 

A food pyramid is a chart (assumes a pyramid shape) that has different sections. Beginning from the base, it introduces the types of foods your child needs to eat. As the pyramid goes up, more periodic types of food that need to be eaten are served. A good food pyramid will show pictures of different types of food in each section along with information about portion sizes and age groups.

A food pyramid (top to bottom) consists of:

- Top Pointed Layer - Foods and drinks that are high in fat, sugar, and salt
- Second layer - fats and oils
- Third layer - meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts
- Fourth layer - milk, curd, cheese, and other dairy products
- Fifth layer - seasonal vegetables and fruits
- Sixth layer - cereals, pulses, legumes, and bread

**Why is the Food Pyramid Important for Children?**

The Importance of Food Pyramid Important for Children because-

- Food pyramids act as an excellent visual aid of the information that they provide which can differ with age ranges in years.
- A food pyramid is a chart to guide and help parents to create nutrient needs as simple as possible to understand the requirements and components of a complete and balanced diet. Growing children need carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber, and fat, regardless, the amount of each of these important components varies with age and gender. 
- Food pyramids convey the guesswork out of trying to figure out what to give your child at each meal. In general, a balanced diet with adequate nutrition includes at least 3 to 5 food groups in each meal.

**What Are The Most Important Key Components Of The Food Pyramid?**

The five main food groups for children that are important key components of the food pyramid are -

1. **Grains (carbohydrate-rich foods)**

Children are involved in a lot of physical activity and therefore need carbohydrates i.e., grains as a source of energy. 

Examples - Grains such as bread, chapattis, rice, oats, cereals, pasta, wheat, quinoa, pancakes, waffles, and cereals.

1. **Vegetables and Fruits (vitamin and mineral rich foods)**

Children require Vitamins and minerals in small amounts to work adequately and remain healthy. Vegetables and Fruits is suitable way to get these two nutrients. 

Examples - Seasonal vegetables such as Green-leafy vegetables like spinach, cauliflower, colored vegetables like carrot, tomato, and so on. 

Fruits like banana, orange, peach and many other fruits that your child prefers

1. **Milk or Dairy (calcium, vitamins, and proteins rich foods)**

These products provide the needed amount of calcium, vitamins, and proteins for your child to support strong bone growth and build strong teeth.

Example - milk, yogurt, curds, paneer, cheese, buttermilk, etc.

1. **Meat/Beans/Fish (protein-rich foods)**

These are a good source of proteins and essential components for child growth which help them in building and replacing the tissues in the their body.

Example - fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, seeds, soya beans, pulses, sprouts

1. **Additionally - Fats and oils (fat rich foods)**

These may sound unhealthy, yet, children need a good amount of fats and oils because they are still proceeding through a developmental phase and involved with a lot of physical activities that require energy. Our body needs fats and oils to protect significant organs, control body temperature, help skin cells & brain.

Examples - butter, mustard oil, ghee, olive, sunflower seeds, and peanuts

***“One of the most important basic requirements for a healthy and balanced diet is water. Therefore, make sure your child's diet is fulfilling by drinking plenty of water or others fluids like watermelon, coconut water, oranges, and buttermilk.”***

**What Is My Plate And How Is It Different From A Food Pyramid?**

A combination of the right amount of different foods can help your children to be healthier now and in the future. It has become a priority for parents of their child's good health and eating healthy with the growing importance. A healthy diet cannot be limited to just a few components. It is shaped by various factors such as your food preferences, life stage, and key to food, culture, personal preferences, and traditions. So a new model named MyPlate has been created by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agency, responsible for nutrition.

**My Plate**

MyPlate is a colorful example of a plate that reminds people to eat a variety of healthy foods and ensures they eat less of some foods and more of others. The plate is divided into four sections and includes a separate section next to the plate indicating the side row.

Following are the plate parts:

- vegetable
- fruit
- grains
- protein
- And a side dish of dairy products

**The differences between a food pyramid and MyPlate is-**

**Which food group statement is correct?**

The presentation of food in a pyramid structure indicates that some foods are very important and others less important. For example, whole grains make up the largest portion, which misleads people into thinking that whole grains are very important, while other products such as fruits and vegetables are less important. However, in MyPlate, the boards are divided as follows:

- Fruits and vegetables - half a plate
- Cereals and protein - about a quarter of a plate

**The divided portion gives a clear idea of the number of nutrients needed**

- **Simple, easy, and comparable model**

The food pyramid has different prototypes that represent food groups. This format is not easy to understand. However, MyPlate follows a simple, easy, and connected format that is we use plates to eat our food. Therefore, the format of using signs indicating the approximate number of these food groups is more straightforward to understand. Every time you eat something, you can modify the amount and modify your meal accordingly.

- **Lack of fat and oil**

The food pyramid includes fats and oils as they are also an important part of our body. However, MyPlate does not contain fats and oils. Some of our foods are prepared with the help of oils and some foods from the major food groups contain fat. Therefore, fats and oils are not listed clear-cut on the plate.

- **Eating less**

The food pyramid indicates the number of servings of each food category that a person should have in a meal. However, MyPlate does not list the number of servings. It only highlights the number of each food group, for example, Shows how to balance the food you eat.

***While these are some guidelines to help you understand the nutrients you need for a balanced diet, make sure you enjoy your food, drink plenty of water, and avoid overeating.***

**Conclusion**

A food pyramid is a tool to guide and provide a framework of a healthy diet with nutrient-rich elements, types, and amounts of food that are to be eaten in combination to provide a healthy diet to a child.

It is designed to solve every problem because the right nutrition will help your child to keep up the energy levels throughout the day but also be beneficial with their physical growth.
